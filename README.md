Wakefield to Jerusalem website.
These are the files that make up the website for the wakefield to jerusalem road trip. 
The roadtrip is taking place on the 24th October 2022. The website is designed to share information and promote the roadtrip.
One of the main aims of the website is for it to be mobile friendly which it currently isn't, any help with this problem would be much appreciated.
